GoDataFeed Hands On Demo
------------------------

http://www.godatafeed.com/

This demo attempts to demonstrate the following coding principles:
1) Creating the WebSite from an Empty template
2) Use WebApi routing variations to expose more methods in same controller
3) Debugging - VStudio, JavaScript, Fiddler and SQL

As part of the interview we will be assessing your hands-on technical knowledge and experience with modern web development technologies, as well as comfort level with Visual Studio and related development tools.  Please bring your laptop with a precompiled web application that you wrote in C# which you will demo and modify during the interview as part of your skills assessment.  It doesn't have to be elaborate; just a simple one-page application, involving the following:
 
Technology Layers
        Database - Store data in a SQL database
        Data Access DLL using LINQ - Code and compile a dll that is referenced by the web application and performs data access via LINQ (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
        Web API Controller - Code the back-end of the web page using a Web API Controller (http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/formats-and-model-binding/content-negotiation) which listens to POST/GET messages from the client side code (JQuery .ajax calls), and interacts with the data layer to retrieve and update data. 
        JSON - Return JSON data from the web API controller to be consumed by the client side code    
        JQuery - Consume the JSON data from the Web API controller, populate page controls and perform basic JQuery actions
 
Expected During Demo
        Walkthrough of the code explaining what is being done in each layer
        Run through the code in debug mode, showing and stepping through the code of each layer
        Modify the code ad-hock, having it perform something slightly different after the initial demo
